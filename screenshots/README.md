# Screenshots (to be captured by the team on your own machine)

The assignment requires screenshots of a successful `docker build`, `docker images`, the running container and the Jupyter notebook. It also requires lifecycle evidence (`docker ps`, `docker ps -a`, `docker logs`, `docker inspect`) and the Docker Hub reproduction.
Save the PNG files in this folder using the names below. Keep the full terminal window visible, including the command you typed.

`docs/validation/` contains a log and a JupyterLab screenshot captured during project validation in a different (sandbox) environment. They show the project working in Docker, but they are **not** a substitute for your own screenshots.
